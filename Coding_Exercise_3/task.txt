Problem S1: Cool Numbers
Problem Description
Eric likes interesting numbers like 64. It turns out that 64 is both a square and a cube, since 64 = 82
and 64 = 43
. Eric calls these numbers cool.
Write a program that helps Eric figure out how many integers in a given range are cool.
Input Description
On the first line of input, you are given an integer a such that a ≥ 1 and a ≤ 108
. On the second
line of input, you are given an integer b such that a ≤ b and b ≤ 108
.
Output Description
The output should be the number of cool numbers in the range a to b (inclusively: that is, a and b
would count as cool numbers in the range if they were actually cool).
